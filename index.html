							<h2 class="major">Privacy Policy</h2>

							<p>AppChunks being a large-scale IT Company, truly believes in the right to privacy of its users. This
								document will shed light on matters related to the privacy policy of the company, along with common
								practices that are pursued for
								the protection of the data and personally identifiable information provided to us. </p>
		
							<p>Here in this policy document, we will discuss in detail that which exact information is collected,
								the reason for the collection of this information, what measures do we take to ensure the protection
								of this information, how and where
								this information is stored, and what exact purposes are served with this information. </p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Which Information Do We Collect?</h5>
							<p>Whenever a user or client interacts directly or indirectly with any of our Software, App, Site, or
								avails any of our services, we may collect some very fundamental information like user name, mailing
								ID, IP Address, etc. There is also
								some non-personal data that we collect and which cannot be linked back to you.</p>
							<p>Apart from these very fundamentals, some other data like the location through IP address, your log
								data, usage information, your device information, and furthermore the data collected through cookies
								is also collected. </p>
							<h5 class="text-head">How Do We Use Your Information?</h5>
							<p>At AppChunks, we only collect all this basic information purely for legitimate purposes and in
								absolute good faith. We collect, process, record, and store this data to appropriately execute the
								contract between our users and us.
								Some other common purposes for the collection of this information are as below</p>
							<ul class="pColor">
								<li>With an intent to communicate with regards to your use of our Software, App, Site or availing
									any of our services. This communication is made for several reasons, i.e., software or app
									updates, to acquire your feedback, to respond
									back to this feedback, for your account verification, to provide you with assistance and support
									in the event of any complications or queries, and for follow up correspondence as well.</li>
								<li>This information also helps us manage our site and products/services in the best possible
									manner, making it more user friendly, ascertaining the true identity of our users for security
									purposes, processing certain transactions
									incurring out of purchases and paid services, in improving the algorithms and performance of our
									site, software, app, and services.</li>
								<li>We use this information to send the users direct email notifications and special offers, if any,
									to send you the promotional and informational content about any new advancements in our
									services, apps, or software, although these
									notifications and emails can be unsubscribed at any time if any of the users arenâ€™t interested
									in them, to connect with them immediately if the need is, in a case where the immediate
									interaction with the user of our services
									is inevitable.</li>
								<li>To execute and process transactions swiftly</li>
								<li>This information helps us improve our products and services, giving us more information about
									consumer preferences and priorities. </li>
							</ul>
							<h5 class="text-head">Do We Exchange Your Data for Any Commercial or Social Reasons?</h5>
							<p>NOT AT ALL. As mentioned earlier that AppChunks is a professional IT Company, and it believes in
								absolute transparency. We respect the privacy of our clients and never tend to breach it no matter
								what; instead, we take all tight
								measures to ensure definite security and protection of the data we attain from our users. We never
								exchange or sell your personal information to any third parties at all, whatever the case may be.
							</p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Plug-ins and Third-Party Apps</h5>
							<p>While using any of our software, apps, site, or services, some third-party plug-ins and apps may try
								to interact and request for your information, but this request would be made straight to the user
								and not to us, nor do we allow any
								such indirect permission at all. </p>
							<p>Therefore, in a case when you come across any such information requests, better analyze them well at
								your own, and only after a hundred percent satisfaction allow them for access, AppChunks would
								never grant this permission to them
								on your behalf even if we have your information already stored. </p>
		
							<h5 class="text-head">When, Why, and With Whom Your Info Might Be Shared?</h5>
							<p>At the very first instance, we never ever share, publicize, or reveal any of your information with
								any third party for any personal, financial, or social gains at all. In some remote exceptions when
								we are contacted by any law enforcing
								agencies LEAs demanding any such information, being bound with the law of the land, only in this
								event your info might be shared with a broader intention of security of land, or, we may also reveal
								this information when the user
								initiates any legal proceedings against us in any court of law or in any arbitrary body, for the
								sake of specifications and identity of the party. Other than these reasons mentioned above, we never
								publicize or reveal your personal
								information. </p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Do We Get Information from Minor Users Too?</h5>
							<p>AppChunks strictly abides by the laws of the land and never knowingly gets any personal information
								from children under the age of 13. In a case where we later realize through any means that some
								certain user is below this age bar
								and his/her information has unknowingly been obtained, we instantly sort the info out and erase it
								even without the request of the user. </p>
							<!-- mobile privacy starts here -->
							<h3 class="policy-hd text-start  pb-0">Mobile Apps Privacy Policy</h3>
							<h5 class="text-head">Which Info is Obtained by the App?</h5>
							<p>As a large-scale professional to the core and reputed organization, AppChunks strongly believes in
								your right to privacy and ensures implementing all staunch measures that guarantee the protection of
								your information. So basically,
								the certain app gets the information that is provided by the user itself when he downloads and
								installs the app. The registration somehow isnâ€™t necessary in all cases but a few features may not
								work unless you donâ€™t register with
								us. During this registration process, the app may usually collect the user name, mailing address,
								password, and a few more such information which is not at all sensitive in nature.</p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Do We Collect any Financial Details?</h5>
							<p>This simple and straight answer to this question is NO. We never demand, acquire, retrieve, or store
								any of your financial information. All the financial transactions between users and us always occur
								through credible third-party platforms
								like banking channels, PayPal and others. AppChunks has nothing to do with any of your financial
								details like Debit or Credit card numbers etc.</p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Information That App Collects Automatically</h5>
							<p>The information that may automatically be collected may include but is not limited to the type of
								device being used, device ID, IP address, mobile operating system, browser info, etc., somehow; the
								app doesnâ€™t collect the precise location
								of the user.</p>
							<h5 class="text-head">Can a User Opt Out at Any Time?</h5>
							<p>Yes. A user can opt-out at any time of his choosing, whenever he decides and makes the mind to not
								allow us any further tracking of the location and retention of the data or information. The user can
								do this instantly by simply uninstalling
								the app from a mobile phone using the most common standard uninstallation processes, or he may also
								request the same by sending us an email which will be acted upon instantly without any questions
								being asked at all.</p>
							<h5 class="text-head">App-Specific Data Retention Policy</h5>
							<p>We may retain some of the fundamental information with us and might keep it stored along with other
								data for a reasonable period of time. In a case where a particular user is willing to delete his
								data and information from our servers
								permanently, they may directly contact us through email and request the same. AppChunks will
								respond to the request in a fairly reasonable time frame. </p>
							<h5 class="text-head">How Do We Ensure the Protection of Your Data?</h5>
							<p>At AppChunks, we are as concerned about your privacy as you are; we always prioritize it and never
								compromise on the sanctity of the information since our professional ethos and moral obligations
								restrict us from doing so. We take
								all measures humanly and technologically possible to take the best possible care of your data and to
								keep it from the access of any third parties. </p>
							<p>We employ the most advanced security firewalls and cyber protocols that may cost us a lot more, but
								we still never tend to compromise even a bit of your information with us. Moreover, even from the
								team of AppChunks, not all members
								may have direct access to this information, and even those who do, also cannot reach it explicitly
								since the information is stored in an encrypted and camouflaged manner. We primarily use this
								information in improving numbers and
								algorithms; for us, this data is nothing more than mere numbers and digits. AppChunks is committed
								to ensuring the absolute safety of the user information at all costs. </p>
